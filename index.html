		<h2>Music🎵</h2>
		<p>
			I listen a lot of music. Particularly <strong>French Rap</strong>. It allows me to relax and escape from reality. It's a unique feeling

		<h2>Travel✈️</h2>
		<p>
			I love to travel. I have traveled to many countries. Firstly with <strong>Family</strong> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧🩷, when I was younger, these were the times when I visited the most historical monuments, such as Spain with the Sagrada Familia. But when I go on vacation with my <strong>Friends</strong> to another country I enjoy more, I party and I have a lot of fun. Both memories are different but memorable

		<h2>Food🍜</h2>
		<p>
			Thanks to my <strong>mother</strong> and my <strong>Grandmother</strong>, I have been cooking since I was a child. I always helped them when preparing dinner. It's a convivial moment. Now I'm the one who cooks for my whole family. I love dishes with lots of sauce and spices </p>
